# Welcome to the Lunar Lander Reinforcement Learning Project!
This project demonstrates the application of various reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms to solve the Lunar Lander problem, a classic control problem provided by OpenAI's Gym environment.

# Overview
* In this project, we train an agent to successfully land a lunar module on a designated landing pad using reinforcement learning.
* The goal is to achieve a soft landing, minimizing the impact velocity and landing within the designated area.
* The agent receives rewards based on its actions, such as maintaining a proper orientation, landing softly, and avoiding crashing.

# Algorithms Implemented
The project includes implementations of the following RL algorithms:

* Deep Q-Network (DQN)
* Double DQN
* Dueling DQN
* Policy Gradient Methods (REINFORCE)
* Actor-Critic Methods (A2C, A3C)
* Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO)

# Getting Started
# Prerequisites
Ensure you have the following installed:

* Python 3.7+
* pip (Python package installer)
* Git

# Results
The results of the training, including the performance metrics and trained models, are saved in the logs/ and models/ directories, respectively. You can visualize the training progress using TensorBoard:
